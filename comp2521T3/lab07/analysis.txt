NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
In the main loop of solve while (!QueueIsEmpty(q)) , 
getNeighbors with a complexity of O(1) will be called repeatedly. 
In the worst case, Maze has only one column and n rows, 
and it needs to call getNeighbors n times, 
so the time complexity is O(n).

============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: 
In the main loop of solve while (!StackIsEmpty(s)) , 
getNeighbors with a complexity of O(1) will be called repeatedly. 
In the worst case, Maze has only one column and n rows, 
and it needs to call getNeighbors n times, 
so the time complexity is O(n).
