========================================================================

------------
Part 1 entry
------------
Main challenges encountered and how you overcame them:
- Initially, I was confused about the size and totalcount values ​​after inserts and deletes, 
sometimes forgetting to change them or changing them repeatedly.

- I streamlined the code logic so that size and totalcount are correctly counted.
------------
Part 2 entry
------------
Main challenges encountered and how you overcame them:
- I forgot to copy tree into a new mset, just change the input mset
- I create a function to copy tree and edit the new tree

------------
Part 3 entry
------------
Main challenges encountered and how you overcame them:
- Most of the previous code needs to be refactored, it takes lot of time
I was not clear about when to recalculate the height and when to do the rotation
in delete, I first iterated to find succ, but this was very troublesome when 
calculating the height and balancing the tree later, so I later changed 
to using recursion and calculating the height and balancing the tree at 
the same time.

Part 4 entry
------------
Main challenges encountered and how you overcame them:
When implementing MsetIndexOf, I mistakenly used -1 as the normal return value to calculate the index.

I added a conditional to return -1 if the recursive return value is -1.
